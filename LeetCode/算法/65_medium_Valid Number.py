Validate if a given string is numeric.

Some examples:
"0" => true
" 0.1 " => true
"abc" => false
"1 a" => false
"2e10" => true
".1" => true

Note: It is intended for the problem statement to be ambiguous. You should gather all requirements up front before implementing one.

Update (2015-02-10):
The signature of the C++ function had been updated. If you still see your function signature accepts a const char * argument, please click the reload button to reset your code definition.

I was asked in the interview of linkedIn, writing it directly can be extremely complicated, for there are many special cases we have to deal with, and the code I wrote was messy. Then I failed to pass the interview.

Here's a clear solution. With DFA we can easily get our idea into shape and then debug, and the source code is clear and simple.

can not agree more Can anyone adjust the test case?

Exactly !!!!

How could "48." is a valid number !!!

"You should gather all requirements." Great, post your cell phone number.

We should use python to f*ck this problem.
